# nasa-app
Nasa-app is a web application created using class-based VUE2, using Vuetify as UI framework.<br />
In this application you will see epic and techport data.<br /> <hr />
The EPIC API provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument. Uniquely positioned at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point, EPIC provides full disc imagery of the Earth and captures unique perspectives of certain astronomical events such as lunar transits using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope.<br /> <hr />
With techport you can see the unique locations captured on mars. It gives you photos from 2 days ago.
